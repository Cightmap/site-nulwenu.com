<h2 id="whatittakestobecomeaprofessionalgamer">What It Takes to Become a Professional Gamer</h2>

<p>Becoming a pro gamer takes hard work. You need to develop skills, build connections, and manage your time. A professional gaming career is real, with several opportunities.</p>

<p>Pro players compete in tournaments to win cash prizes. These esports athletes are sometimes part of an esports team, or paid by sponsors. <a href="https://www.statista.com/outlook/amo/esports/worldwide" target="_blank">Esports revenues are projected at $4.3 billion</a>, showing how they made a global impression.</p>

<h3 id="choosingtherightgameandplatform">Choosing the Right Game and Platform</h3>

<p>When starting out, select one game, platform, and genre. It is tough for newcomers to go &quot;pro&quot; in long-standing games like League of Legends or Counter-Strike: Global Offensive. These esports titles have large, dedicated player bases.</p>

<p>Some up-and-coming games give people the chance to advance. Some even become founding players. Keep in mind, it is a risk to join that scene if the game flops.</p>

<p>So, we recommend picking a game, trying out others, and sticking with the one you like. There are so many genres of video games out there that finding the one that best suits you might take some trial and error. Popular genres in the gaming industry are:</p>

<ul>
	<li>First Person Shooter (FPS)</li>
	<li>Multiplayer Online Battle Arena (MOBA)</li>
	<li>Real-Time Strategy (RTS)</li>
	<li>Fighting Games</li>
	<li>Battle Royale</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="joiningthegamingcommunity">Joining the Gaming Community</h3>

<p>Getting good at video games is one part, but networking is important. You need to build relationships in the gaming community. Check out places like online message boards and use quick links to find gaming communities.</p>

<p>Interacting helps pro gamers learn tips from other players. The culture of gaming is key to progressing in your pro gaming career. Community motivates people to keep playing the game.</p>

<p>Consider joining gaming-related social media groups to connect with other gamers. Look for Discord servers, Reddit communities, and Facebook groups. Use advanced search features on these platforms to find relevant discussions.</p>

<h3 id="practicing">Practicing</h3>

<p>Pro gamers develop skills by investing time in games they master. Hand-eye coordination and problem-solving build skills, such as sharp reflexes, to succeed. Playing video games consistently is the best way to develop as an esports athlete.</p>

<p>Premium matchmaking services like ESEA and in-game matchmaking can get you started. They help you find players to compete against. But to win, a pro gamer really needs consistent practice.</p>

<p>Many people play video games, but only a select few can spend hours practicing. People who spend time honing their skills are typically the ones who make it.</p>

<h3 id="therightgearandsetup">The Right Gear and Set Up</h3>

<p>You might be surprised that many esports players earn an annual salary of $60,000. This will depend on skill. People who are considered to be some of the best players will have higher paying salaries than newcomers.</p>

<p>Pro gaming event organizers need system components, so gameplay avoids frame rate issues or lags. Investing in things like a good gaming PC helps. The right gaming peripherals can give a competitive advantage, so consider things like this:</p>
