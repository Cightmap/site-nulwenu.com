<h2 id="whatmakesdungeoncrawlclassicsdifferent">What Makes Dungeon Crawl Classics Different?</h2>

<p>At its core, Dungeon Crawl Classics (DCC) is a <strong>role-playing game</strong> that seeks to capture the feel of early, foundational fantasy RPGs. However, <a href="https://goodman-games.com/dungeon-crawl-classics-rpg" target="_blank">Goodman Games</a> designed DCC with modern sensibilities, making it familiar and refreshingly different. <strong>Goodman Games supports dcc</strong> with many official products.</p>

<p>Published by Goodman Games, <strong>Dungeon Crawl Classics Role Playing Game</strong> uses the Open Game License and System Reference Document version 3.5. This made DCC compatible with the revised third edition of Dungeons &amp; Dragons.</p>

<h3 id="anodtothepastasteptowardsthefuture">A Nod to the Past, A Step Towards the Future</h3>

<p><strong>Dungeon Crawl Classics</strong> attempts to channel what its creators felt were key ingredients that made original <strong>roleplaying games</strong> exciting. This often meant taking a bit of a &quot;back to basics&quot; approach.</p>

<p>One of the goals of <strong>Dungeon Crawl Classics</strong> is <strong>fast play</strong>. Although a modern game, it still maintains some classic roleplaying elements, <strong>paying homage</strong> to that late 1970&#39;s game-style.</p>

<h3 id="keyelementsandmechanics">Key Elements and Mechanics</h3>

<p>Let&#39;s get into some of the nuts and bolts. <strong>DCC RPG</strong> has a few mechanics and ideas that make it different from other games.</p>

<p>One of the biggest things is &quot;The Funnel.&quot; All players begin with multiple 0-level characters that typically start with low stats, simple equipment, and then must battle their way to level 1. These 0-level characters need to survive deadly encounters to prove they are in fact heroes.</p>

<p>Combat has things called Mighty Deeds. Mighty Deeds gives non-magic-users something extra to do besides basic attacks. Some call it &quot;the game that [they] wish wizards were in Dungeons and Dragons&quot;.</p>

<p>The magic system avoids fixed spell slots. It encourages taking risks when casting for added randomness and effects that aren&#39;t possible to do within the bounds of D\&amp;D rules. </p>

<p>Wizards contend with things, like corruptions for casting spells. A <strong>tight-lipped warlock guarding long-dead secrets</strong> is a common trope found in DCC.</p>

<h3 id="zocchidice">Zocchi Dice</h3>

<p><strong>Dungeon Crawl Classics</strong> doesn&#39;t limit itself to standard dice. While traditional dice like d6s and d20s are used, DCC uses dice like the d7, d16 and d24 to add some randomness and chaos.</p>

<p>For many players, gathering those <strong>rpg</strong> <strong>dice</strong> can be its own adventure. The <strong>dcc rpg dice</strong> are often referred to as Zocchi Dice, named after their creator Lou Zocchi.</p>

<h2 id="communityandsupportarounddcc">Community and Support around DCC</h2>

<p><strong>DCC RPG</strong> seems to have developed a strong community over the years. There are resources from <strong>Goodman Games</strong>, who have released settings and expansions, many available on DriveThruRPG. A <strong>judge&#39;s screen</strong> is one of many products that is available for the game.</p>

<p>You can find people playing <strong>dungeon crawl classics</strong> both online and off. Some report finding groups easily, with numerous conventions and online platforms having places for people to join a game of DCC.</p>

<h3 id="thirdpartycontentiswelcome">Third-Party Content is Welcome</h3>

<p><strong>Goodman Games</strong> has extended an open invitation to let other creators come up with <strong>adventure modules</strong>, new rules and more for their DCC systems. Many creators have created products in almost every conceivable setting imaginable.</p>

<p><strong>Goodman Games</strong> also supports these 3rd-party publishers through a free license. This gives access to make changes to DCC without issues, something unheard of in many tabletop games. A <strong>rules set</strong> that is open and easy to work with is a large draw to this game.</p>

<h3 id="gettingstarted">Getting Started</h3>

<p>There seem to be many resources available for newcomers. Even for a quick pickup game at an event.</p>

<p>Some Games Masters (referred to as Judges in the game), even create zero-level characters for folks using the <a href="https://purplesorcerer.com/create_party.php" target="_blank">Purple Sorceror 0-Level Party generator</a> to save time. These characters often get rolled up very quickly. It helps streamline getting players to <strong>seek gold</strong> and glory as soon as possible.</p>

<h2 id="dcccomparedtoothersystems">DCC Compared to Other Systems</h2>

<p>How does <strong>Dungeon Crawl Classics</strong> stack up against other role-playing systems? How is it similar or different to other roleplaying games, or is there even any similarity at all?</p>

<p>These comparisons get down to personal preferences. Some differences include different game philosophies and even game mechanics themselves.</p>

<h3 id="dccvsdd5e">DCC vs D\&amp;D 5e</h3>

<p><strong>Dungeon Crawl Classics</strong> attempts to go &quot;back to basics&quot;, making things less simple, but a little chaotic compared to 5e. Where 5e is well known for class balancing and encounter design, <strong>Dungeon Crawl Classics</strong> thrives on risks and has that dangerous dungeon vibe.</p>

<h3 id="dccvsotherosrgames">DCC vs. Other OSR Games</h3>

<p>DCC fits into that &quot;Old School Renaissance&quot; but its mechanics move past simple retro-clones. Although designed around old school values, games can be unpredictable.</p>

<p>Other systems will focus on giving rules-lite games. Some may value flexibility or creating an easier game than those early systems provided.</p>

<p>DCC offers a unique blend. The <strong>open-feeling rules set</strong> still has some modern elements while maintaining a focus on an old school play style.</p>

<h2 id="isdccrpgforyouthinkingaboutplaying">Is DCC RPG For You? Thinking About Playing?</h2>

<p>So is <strong>dungeon crawl classics</strong> worth getting into? Ultimately, the best thing to consider is what *you* enjoy out of a TTRPG.</p>

<p>If those potential campaigns involve danger at every corner where PCs often die, or just want random, chaotic elements - DCC might just be the solution for you. Many people online who played and talked about <strong>Dungeon Crawl Classics</strong> report that they liked those key parts of gameplay.</p>

<h3 id="whataboutpeoplewantingmorecrunch">What About People Wanting More Crunch?</h3>

<p>People wanting more detailed character customization may find 5e appealing, however. If those details are vital, they should look towards other modern systems that give these type of mechanics for building out and progressing characters.</p>

<p>Those looking to jump right into a game with established rules for a long time will like that DCC is a contained game, but so is other classic fantasy-style RPGs. It is very easy to find a pickup game to play or even participate on online game.</p>

<h3 id="isitpossibletotakethingsfromdcc">Is it Possible to Take Things from DCC?</h3>

<p>Some game masters like taking concepts, not entire systems. One that seems to be highly sought after is the &quot;Mighty Deeds&quot; which is used in DCC. It could find a home as a homebrew idea in many other games.</p>

<h2 id="embracingtheunpredictable">Embracing the Unpredictable</h2>

<p><strong>DCC RPG</strong> embraces the unknown, in some cases *literally*. This has led to a great many ideas created that people find unique.</p>

<p>Magic has chaos baked in to reflect dealing with powers that are possibly other-worldly. This results in a situation where using such power becomes dangerous, creating <a href="https://mythicmountainsrpg.substack.com/p/review-dungeon-crawl-classics-by" target="_blank">magical side effects that are not normally experienced with other systems</a>.</p>

<h3 id="adventurearoundeverycorner">Adventure Around Every Corner?</h3>

<p>Because a great number of things rely on random tables and a dice-driven gameplay, some feel DCC brings back that exploration. Things such as critical hits add even more, where each class having their own, often changing fights completely.</p>

<p>Characters may be tasked with adventuring into the <strong>Shudder Mountains</strong>, or a location that <strong>gold was won deep</strong> within. Many classic feeling adventures exist.</p>
